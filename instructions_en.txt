1. In the following experiment we will show you a series of shapes in different colours.
(press any key)

2. When you will see a red square press space as quickly as possible.

3. This is how the red square looks like.

4. We will start with a practice run. Press any key whenever you are ready. Remember to press space ONLY when you see a red square!

5. This concludes the training phase.

6. We will now start with the proper test. It will be longer and there will be no feedback. Remember to only press space when you see a red square.
